# ⚔️ ThreatTwin – Visualize Cyber Threats in Real-Time

**ThreatTwin** is a real-time cybersecurity visualization tool developed during a hackathon to **educate users** and **simulate digital attacks** through animated storytelling. It transforms complex cyber threats into intuitive visual experiences using modular, lightweight animations.

> 🔐 Because understanding cyber threats shouldn’t require reading logs.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

ThreatTwin uses Lottie-based animations to simulate various cybersecurity events:

| Threat           | Animation File       | Description                           |
|------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| 🔓 Data Breach   | `data_breach.json`   | Lock opens, symbolizing a breach      |
| 🧨 Malware Glitch| `glitch.json`        | Rapid flicker effect for anomalies    |
| 🔐 Lockdown      | `lock.json`          | Shows secured/locked state            |
| 💰 Bitcoin       | `bitcoin.json`       | Visualizes a Bitcoin-style transaction|
| ☠️ Threat Alert  | `skull.json`         | Represents active cyber threat        |
| ✅ Defense       | `success.json`       | Green checkmark shows success         |
